Unity third person shooter

You are a scientist/space marine looking for a cure to the genetic mutations caused by Particle Radiation. This is a survival game where you travel around a power plant searching for clues to a cure. As you travel to differnt areas, your alpha, beta and gamma particle counts get higher, giving you certain abilities.

Alpha particles will give you strength, Beta will give you sense, Gamma will give you speed. All three will give you an undetermined power. Unfortunate citizens exposed to too much of all three turn into The Decayed, losing their ability to think rationally but gaining some of the abilities, until they decay to dust particles. You are searching for a cure while surviving and picking up items to aid you. 

The Decayed now rely on their senses and feed off low radiated humans, aka you. The cure is formed from pieces of Special Decayed, obtained from destroying them. There will be destructable items for killing enemies, all you have is a pistol, unlimited ammo?

The decayed will always head in straight lines for you, that is, they can be stopped by having a wall between you and them, however most walls will be destructable, so it's only a matter of time. Any obstacles will be a hindrance to the Decayed, but they can break most obstacles. The special Decayed will make a sound when they approach and call more decayed to attack you.

The player's gieger counter will have three bars indicating Alpha, Beta and Gamma particle radiation levels. As you walk around outside and in "hotspots" inside, certain levels will increase. You can lower these amounts by ingesting Iodine, Magnesium, or Calcium tablets found as you walk around. Iodine for Alpha, Magnesium for Beta, and Calcium for Gamma. However, the levels will never go down without these. If you max one of the 3, the following would occur:

A. Alpha - You get the "Megaton Punch" ability, but you no longer can hold your pistol. You are only able to punch once every second, however it blows objects away and your skin gets hardened, so that you take less physical damage from contact.
B. Beta - You get the "Tele-jump" ability and keep your pistol out, where you can "teleport" long distances around the map and shoot from a distance.
C. Gamma - You get the "Hide" ability and keep your pistol, where you can mask your scent so that the Decayed no longer can see you, unless you touch them or get too close. This is good for walking past large groups or getting out of danger.

These three abilities cannot be combined, unless all three are met. This will give you an undetermined power. However, after it's effects you will be very weak and slow, needing a First Aid kit to heal yourself.

The Special Decayed, will be the bosses of the locations, where you will need to perform a special task to defeat them. I.E. Set on fire, use Alpha powers, etc.

Main Gameplay - Shooting in location of cursor (implied crosshair on location of mouse), strong force with alpha particles, increased movement with Beta particles, special decay that spawns, decayed will run in sttraight line towards player once player gets within 5 meters of one of them, unless charged with Gamma particles, picking up first aid or radiation help, destructable objects and fire, display of radiation levels, health, ammo, and minimap.
